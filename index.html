    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <li>Dr. Ke Yu has a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from Wuhan University in China. He obtained his master’s degree in Hydrobiology from Chinese Academy of Sciences and Ph.D. degrees in Environmental Engineering from the University of Hong Kong. His dissertation was focused on developing of methodology of meta-omics (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, etc.) methodology an innovative aerobic granulation system to treat industrial wastewater. After his Ph.D. defense, he joined the University of California at Berkeley as a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering where he investigated central metabolisms in important bioremediation anaerobic bacteria by using genetic engineering, genomics and metagenomics, and metabolomics techniques. Prior to joining the University of Auckland, he worked as an Assistant Scientist at the Center for Re-Inventing the Nation’s Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) at UC Berkeley to develop an energy and cost effective nitrogen removal process built upon anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria. </li>
